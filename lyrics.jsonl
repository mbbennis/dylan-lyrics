{"artist": "Bob Dylan", "title": "Tempest", "album": "Tempest", "lyrics": "The pale moon rose in its glory\nOut on the Western town\nShe told a sad, sad story\nOf the great ship that went down\n\nIt was the fourteenth day of April\nOver the waves she rode\nSailing into tomorrow\nTo a golden age foretold\n\nThe night was black with starlight\nThe seas were sharp and clear\nMoving through the shadows\nThe promised hour was near\n\nLights were holding steady\nGliding over the foam\nAll the lords and ladies\nHeading for their eternal home\n\nThe chandeliers were swaying\nFrom the balustrades above\nThe orchestra was playing\nSongs of faded love\n\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\nAs the ballroom dancers twirled\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\nInto the underworld\n\nLeo took his sketchbook\nHe was often so inclined\nHe closed his eyes and painted\nThe scenery in his mind\n\nCupid struck his bosom\nAnd broke it with a snap\nThe closest woman to him\nHe fell into her lap\n\nHe heard a loud commotion\nSomething sounded wrong\nHis inner spirit was saying\nThat he couldn't stand here long\n\nHe staggered to the quarterdeck\nNo time now to sleep\nWater on the quarterdeck\nAlready three foot deep\n\nSmokestack was leaning sideways\nHeavy feet began to pound\nHe walked into the whirlwind\nSky splitting all around\n\nThe ship was going under\nThe universe had opened wide\nThe roll was called up yonder\nThe angels turned aside\n\nLights down in the hallway\nFlickering dim and dull\nDead bodies already floating\nIn the double bottom hull\n\nThe engines then exploded\nPropellers they failed to start\nThe boilers overloaded\nThe ship's bow split apart\n\nPassengers were flying\nBackward, forward, far and fast\nThey mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled\nEach one more weary than the last\n\nThe veil was torn asunder\n'Tween the hours of twelve and one\nNo change, no sudden wonder\nCould undo what had been done\n\nThe watchman lay there dreaming\nAt forty five degrees\nHe dreamed that the Titanic was sinking\nDropping to her knees\n\nWellington he was sleeping\nHis bed began to slide\nHis valiant heart was beating\nHe pushed the tables aside\n\nGlass of shattered crystal\nLay scattered roundabout\nHe strapped on both his pistols\nHow long could he hold out?\n\nHis men and his companions\nWere nowhere to be seen\nIn silence there he waited for\nTime and space to intervene\n\nThe passageway was narrow\nThere was blackness in the air\nHe saw every kind of sorrow\nHeard voices everywhere\n\nAlarm-bells were ringing\nTo hold back the swelling tide\nFriends and lovers clinging\nTo each other side by side\n\nMothers and their daughters\nDescending down the stairs\nJumped into the icy waters\nLove and pity sent their prayers\n\nThe rich man, Mister Astor\nKissed his darling wife\nHe had no way of knowing\nIt'd be the last trip of his life\n\nCalvin, Blake and Wilson\nGambled in the dark\nNot one of them would ever live to\nTell the tale on the disembark\n\nBrother rose up 'gainst brother\nIn every circumstance\nThey fought and slaughtered each other\nIn a deadly dance\n\nThey lowered down the lifeboats\nFrom the sinking wreck\nThere were traitors, there were turncoats\nBroken backs and broken necks\n\nThe bishop left his cabin\nTo help others in need\nTurned his eyes up to the heavens\nSaid, \"The poor are yours to feed\"\n\nDavey the brothel-keeper\nCame out dismissed his girls\nSaw the water getting deeper\nSaw the changing of his world\n\nJim Dandy smiled\nHe never learned to swim\nSaw the little crippled child\nAnd he gave his seat to him\n\nHe saw the starlight shining\nStreaming from the East\nDeath was on the rampage\nBut his heart was now at peace\n\nThey battened down the hatches\nBut the hatches wouldn't hold\nThey drowned upon the staircase\nOf brass and polished gold\n\nLeo said to Cleo\nI think I'm going mad\nBut he'd lost his mind already\nWhatever mind he had\n\nHe tried to block the doorway\nTo save all those from harm\nBlood from an open wound\nPouring down his arm\n\nPetals fell from flowers\n'Til all of them were gone\nIn the long and dreadful hours\nThe wizard's curse played on\n\nThe host was pouring brandy\nHe was going down slow\nHe stayed right to the end and he\nWas the last to go\n\nThere were many, many others\nNameless here forever more\nThey never sailed the ocean\nOr left their homes before\n\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\nThe damage had been done\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\nAnd he tried to tell someone\n\nThe captain, barely breathing\nKneeling at the wheel\nAbove him and beneath him\nFifty thousand tons of steel\n\nHe looked over at his compass\nAnd he gazed into its face\nNeedle pointing downward\nHe knew he'd lost the race\n\nIn the dark illumination\nHe remembered bygone years\nHe read the Book of Revelation\nAnd he filled his cup with tears\n\nWhen the Reaper's task had ended\nSixteen hundred had gone to rest\nThe good, the bad, the rich, the poor\nThe loveliest and the best\n\nThey waited at the landing\nAnd they tried to understand\nBut there is no understanding\nOn the judgment of God's hand\n\nThe news came over the wires\nAnd struck with deadly force\nLove had lost its fires\nAll things had run their course\n\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\nOf all the things that can be\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\nInto the deep blue sea"}

You could tell she was\nSo broken-hearted\nShe said \"Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt\"\n\n\"How far are you all going ?\" Ruby asked us with a sigh\n\"We're going all the way until the wheels fall off and burn\nUntil the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies\"\nRuby just smiled and said. \"Ah you know some babies never learn\"\n\nSomething about that movie though well I just can't get it out of my head\nBut I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play\nAll I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved\nAnd a lot of them seemed to be looking my way\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love\n\nWell they were looking for somebody with a pompadour\nI was crossing the street when shots rang out\nI didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran\nWe got him cornered in the churchyard? I heard somebody shout\n\nWell you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it it said\n\"A man with no alibi\"\nYou went out on a limb to testify for me you said I was with you\nThen when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears\nIt was the best acting I saw anybody do\n\nNow I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes\nYou just find yourself over the line\nOh if there's an original thought out there I could use it right now\nYou know I feel pretty good but that ain't saying much I could feel a whole lot better\nIf you were just here by my side to show me how\nWell I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck\nYeah but you know it's not the one that I had in mind\nHe's got a new one out now I don't even know what it's about\nBut I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love\n\nYou know it's funny how things never turn out the way you had them planned\nThe only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name\nWasn't Henry Porter\nAnd you know there was something about you baby that I liked that was always too\nGood for this world\nJust like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind\nIn the French Quarter\n\nStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who\nAre most content\nI don't have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone\nYou always said people don't do what they believe in they just do what's most\nConvenient then they repent\nAnd I always said. \"Hang on to me baby and let's hope that the roof stays on\"\n\nThere was a movie I seen one time I think I sat through it twice\nI don't remember who I was or where I was bound\nAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck he wore a gun and he was shot\nIn the back\nSeems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love"}
